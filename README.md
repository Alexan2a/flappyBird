## What is this project?
A Mini-game flappy bird. This is my trial to learn how to use canvas javascript. I tried to make it minimalistic, but animated and pleasant.
## Tecnologies used
This is a small project, made with pure JS, HTML and CSS. And a little bit of Photoshop to create those pictures.
Some details I'd like to mention:
* High Score is saved in local storage
* Bird has physics
* Background objects move with different speed, to make effect of perspective

*Hope you like it!*
